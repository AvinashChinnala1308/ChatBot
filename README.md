# Chatbot
The project aims to build an intelligent documentation assistant in the form of a chatbot that provides quick, accurate answers from GitHubâ€™s official documentation. This chatbot will allow users to ask natural language questions about GitHub functionalities, workflows, and best practices and receive precise responses based on the latest GitHub Docs. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to process the documentation content and storing it in a Neo4j graph database, the assistant will efficiently retrieve relevant information. The interface, built with Streamlit, will be user-friendly, enabling users to seamlessly interact with complex technical documentation through simple queries, significantly enhancing accessibility and efficiency.
